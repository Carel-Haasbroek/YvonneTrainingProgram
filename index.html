                <li>
                    Remember, to achieve weight loss while training hard, you either need to train more or eat less. Not both.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don't rest less than 2 min. Rest is just as important as the volume of training.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sets/reps format is Sets x Reps. Meaning that 3x4 means 3 sets of 4 reps.

                        <p>
                            These exercises should <b>not</b> take a lot of energy or time. The goal of these is to help condition the body for more intense
                            training down the line. The athlete should still have energy for the day and afternoon training after this.

                            2x 2 min plank. if you cant make the whole time, rest 10-20 secs then try again as the timer tics. <br>
                            2x 2 min bicycle crunch <br>
                            2x 2 min russian twists. one each side <br>

                            Situps till collapse <br>
                            The goal of these are to track your improvement as you go on in the year. The ultimate goal is a really big number where its no longer an exercise but a formality.
                            You will begin strong, then dip for a few weeks (2-4), and only then should you see consistent improvement.
